## Questions
<br>

#### Question-1: Countdown Blastoff (While Loop)

Create a program that simulates a rocket launch countdown using a while loop. Start from 10 and countdown to "Blastoff!" with a one-second delay between each countdown number. Print a message when the rocket launches.

**Hint:** You may want to use `cat` command to print the countdown and `Sys.sleep` for incorporating the delay

**Output preview:** Here is how the countdown could look like 

```{r, out.height= "20px",out.width= "200px",echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics("images/countdown.png")
```

```{r, out.height= "20px",out.width= "200px",echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics("images/blastoff.png")
```

**Solutions:**

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
countdown <- 10

while (countdown >= 0) {
  if (countdown == 0) {
    cat("Blastoff!\n")
  } else {
    cat("Countdown:", countdown, "\n")
  }
  
  Sys.sleep(1)  # Delay of 1 second
  countdown <- countdown - 1
}

cat("Rocket has launched!\n")

```

#### Question-2: Word Reverser (for Loop)

Develop a program that takes a user-entered word and uses a while loop to print the word's characters in reverse order. For example, if the user enters "hello," the program should print "olleh."

**Hint:** You may want to use `substr` command to access each character of the input word, and `paste` command to join the reversed letters one at a time

**Solutions:** 

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here
reverse_word <- function(word) {
  reversed <- ""  
  i <- nchar(word) 
  while (i > 0) {
    reversed <- paste0(reversed, substr(word, i, i))
    i <- i - 1  
  }
  return(reversed)  
}

reverse_word("tacocat1")

```
