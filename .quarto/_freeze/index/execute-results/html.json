However, this has proven not be an ironclad rule, time and time again by exceptional individuals such as the 1.6m Muggsy Bogues or the 1.75m Isaiah Thomas(the one who played for the Celtics, not the Pistons point guard he was named after). But then again, just looking at the results of these individuals alone would be invoking survivorship bias. Which begs the question, how do the comparatively shorter players stack up against the \"average\" NBA player.\n\n\nHere's what the \"average\" NBA player's stats look like. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 8\n  player_name    player_height    gp   pts   reb   ast net_rating season\n  <chr>                  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>      <dbl> <chr> \n1 Average Player          201.    64   5.6   2.5     1       -1.8 <NA>  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI say average, but these numbers are actually the median of their respective columns.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 10 × 8\n# Groups:   player_name, net_rating [5]\n   player_name    player_height    gp   pts   reb   ast net_rating season \n   <chr>                  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>      <dbl> <chr>  \n 1 John Stockton           185.    82  14.4   2.8  10.5       11.4 1996-97\n 2 John Stockton           185.    82  11.5   2.8   8.7       11.4 2000-01\n 3 Lindsey Hunter          188.    82  14.2   2.8   1.9        5.1 1996-97\n 4 Lindsey Hunter          188.    82  10.1   2.1   2.7        5.1 2000-01\n 5 Mark Blount             213.    82  10.3   7.2   0.9        0.4 2003-04\n 6 Mark Blount             213.    82   9.4   4.8   1.6        0.4 2004-05\n 7 Bobby Simmons           198.    75  16.4   5.9   2.7        0.4 2004-05\n 8 Bobby Simmons           198.    75  13.4   4.4   2.3        0.4 2005-06\n 9 Johnny Newman           201.    82   8.7   2.3   1.4        0.2 1996-97\n10 Johnny Newman           201.    82  10     1.9   0.8        0.2 1999-00\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 10 × 8\n# Groups:   player_name, net_rating [5]\n   player_name    player_height    gp   pts   reb   ast net_rating season \n   <chr>                  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>      <dbl> <chr>  \n 1 John Stockton           185.    82  14.4   2.8  10.5       11.4 1996-97\n 2 John Stockton           185.    82  11.5   2.8   8.7       11.4 2000-01\n 3 Lindsey Hunter          188.    82  14.2   2.8   1.9        5.1 1996-97\n 4 Lindsey Hunter          188.    82  10.1   2.1   2.7        5.1 2000-01\n 5 Mark Blount             213.    82  10.3   7.2   0.9        0.4 2003-04\n 6 Mark Blount             213.    82   9.4   4.8   1.6        0.4 2004-05\n 7 Bobby Simmons           198.    75  16.4   5.9   2.7        0.4 2004-05\n 8 Bobby Simmons           198.    75  13.4   4.4   2.3        0.4 2005-06\n 9 Johnny Newman           201.    82   8.7   2.3   1.4        0.2 1996-97\n10 Johnny Newman           201.    82  10     1.9   0.8        0.2 1999-00\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo learn more about Daniel, navigate to the \"About\" section.\nGitHub Page link:\n\nhttps://github.com/IDrinkTapWater/idrinktapwater.github.io\n",
