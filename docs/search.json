    "text": "When I think of NBA players, the first image that comes to mind is a hulking giant of a man, the second image that comes to mind is this (insert picture of kevin hart next to shaq). In a sport where the goal is to get the ball into a basket 10 feet off the ground and to prevent the other team from doing the same, naturally, one would come to the conclusion that height is the deciding factor. However, this has proven not be an ironclad rule, time and time again by exceptional individuals such as the (insertheight) Muggsy Bogues or the (insertheight) (insertname). But then again, just looking at the results of these individuals alone would be invoking survivorship bias. Which begs the question, how do the comparatively shorter players stack up against the “average” NBA player.\nHere’s what the “average” NBA player’s stats look like.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 8\n  player_name    player_height    gp   pts   reb   ast net_rating season\n  &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n1 Average Player          201.    64   5.6   2.5     1       -1.8 &lt;NA&gt;  \n\n\nI say average, but these numbers are actually the median of their respective columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 8\n# Groups:   player_name, net_rating [5]\n   player_name    player_height    gp   pts   reb   ast net_rating season \n   &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  \n 1 John Stockton           185.    82  14.4   2.8  10.5       11.4 1996-97\n 2 John Stockton           185.    82  11.5   2.8   8.7       11.4 2000-01\n 3 Lindsey Hunter          188.    82  14.2   2.8   1.9        5.1 1996-97\n 4 Lindsey Hunter          188.    82  10.1   2.1   2.7        5.1 2000-01\n 5 Mark Blount             213.    82  10.3   7.2   0.9        0.4 2003-04\n 6 Mark Blount             213.    82   9.4   4.8   1.6        0.4 2004-05\n 7 Bobby Simmons           198.    75  16.4   5.9   2.7        0.4 2004-05\n 8 Bobby Simmons           198.    75  13.4   4.4   2.3        0.4 2005-06\n 9 Johnny Newman           201.    82   8.7   2.3   1.4        0.2 1996-97\n10 Johnny Newman           201.    82  10     1.9   0.8        0.2 1999-00\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 8\n# Groups:   player_name, net_rating [5]\n   player_name    player_height    gp   pts   reb   ast net_rating season \n   &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  \n 1 John Stockton           185.    82  14.4   2.8  10.5       11.4 1996-97\n 2 John Stockton           185.    82  11.5   2.8   8.7       11.4 2000-01\n 3 Lindsey Hunter          188.    82  14.2   2.8   1.9        5.1 1996-97\n 4 Lindsey Hunter          188.    82  10.1   2.1   2.7        5.1 2000-01\n 5 Mark Blount             213.    82  10.3   7.2   0.9        0.4 2003-04\n 6 Mark Blount             213.    82   9.4   4.8   1.6        0.4 2004-05\n 7 Bobby Simmons           198.    75  16.4   5.9   2.7        0.4 2004-05\n 8 Bobby Simmons           198.    75  13.4   4.4   2.3        0.4 2005-06\n 9 Johnny Newman           201.    82   8.7   2.3   1.4        0.2 1996-97\n10 Johnny Newman           201.    82  10     1.9   0.8        0.2 1999-00\n\n\nTo learn more about Daniel, navigate to the “About” section.
